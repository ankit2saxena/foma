With PlusMinusOne on the stack, the command apply up 9 returns 10; and apply down 10 returns 9. 
The apply up commands works for positive integers of any size but the apply down command does not yield any output for numbers smaller that 1.

With PlusMinusOneNeg on the stack, the command apply down -4 returns -5 and apply up -3 returns -2.
